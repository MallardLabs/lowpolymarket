**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive tests so that I can confidently make changes without breaking existing functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code is written THEN it SHALL have unit tests covering all business logic
2. WHEN components interact THEN there SHALL be integration tests validating the complete flow
3. WHEN the system is under load THEN there SHALL be performance tests ensuring scalability
4. WHEN mocking is needed THEN the system SHALL provide proper mock frameworks for Discord and database
5. WHEN edge cases exist THEN there SHALL be property-based tests validating input boundaries
6. WHEN tests run THEN they SHALL provide coverage reports and performance metrics

### Requirement 5: Configuration Management

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want centralized configuration so that I can easily manage different environments and settings.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system starts THEN it SHALL load configuration from environment variables and files
2. WHEN configuration changes THEN the system SHALL validate all settings before startup
3. WHEN different environments are used THEN the system SHALL support development, staging, and production configs
4. WHEN sensitive data is stored THEN it SHALL be properly secured and not logged
5. WHEN configuration is invalid THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages
6. WHEN settings are accessed THEN they SHALL be type-safe and validated

### Requirement 6: Monitoring and Observability

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want comprehensive monitoring so that I can detect and resolve issues before they affect users.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system runs THEN it SHALL provide health check endpoints for all critical components
2. WHEN operations are performed THEN the system SHALL log structured data with appropriate levels
3. WHEN metrics are needed THEN the system SHALL collect performance data and system statistics
4. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL provide detailed error tracking with unique identifiers
5. WHEN system health changes THEN it SHALL provide alerting capabilities
6. WHEN debugging is needed THEN the system SHALL provide comprehensive logging and tracing

### Requirement 7: Security Enhancements

**User Story:** As a user, I want my data and interactions to be secure so that I can trust the system with my information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN input is received THEN the system SHALL sanitize and validate all user inputs
2. WHEN database queries are made THEN the system SHALL prevent SQL injection attacks
3. WHEN users make requests THEN the system SHALL implement rate limiting per user and guild
4. WHEN operations are performed THEN the system SHALL log all actions for audit purposes
5. WHEN sensitive data is handled THEN it SHALL be encrypted at rest and in transit
6. WHEN authentication is needed THEN the system SHALL use secure token-based authentication

### Requirement 8: Data Validation

**User Story:** As a developer, I want robust data validation so that invalid data never enters the system and causes issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN prediction data is created THEN it SHALL validate question length, options count, and duration
2. WHEN bets are placed THEN it SHALL validate amounts, user IDs, and prediction existence
3. WHEN API requests are made THEN it SHALL use schema validation for all inputs
4. WHEN data types are used THEN they SHALL be strongly typed with proper validation
5. WHEN validation fails THEN it SHALL provide specific error messages indicating what's wrong
6. WHEN data is processed THEN it SHALL sanitize inputs to prevent injection attacks

### Requirement 9: Rate Limiting and Abuse Prevention

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to prevent abuse and ensure fair usage so that all users have equal access to the system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN users make requests THEN the system SHALL limit requests per user per time window
2. WHEN guilds use the bot THEN it SHALL limit requests per guild to prevent server overload
3. WHEN rate limits are exceeded THEN the system SHALL provide clear feedback to users
4. WHEN suspicious activity is detected THEN it SHALL log and potentially block the activity
5. WHEN legitimate users are affected THEN the system SHALL provide bypass mechanisms for administrators
